  <h1>For class, to prove I did it</h1>
    <p>This is the recipes web-thinga-majinga that odin project ask you to do. Might actually dig some recipes i like to put here.</p>
    <p>This is mostly to prove to myself that I can  do this kinda of stuff. Also, self imposed rule, minimum swearing. Swearing through text is weird. It's alright to read, it's weird to write. :P</p>
