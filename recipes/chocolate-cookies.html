  <h1>Chocolate cookies recipe</h1>
    <p>This a simple chocolate cookie recipe, you should get some cakey, fluffy and really good cookies out of this, pretty quick recipe, it takes me about 1 hour or so to make, maybe a little less, depends on the day.</p>
    <p>The part where I talk, or write, about how i got this recipe is at the bottom. Not wasting time here folks.</p>

        <li><input type="checkbox" class="checkbox-ingredients" >2 eggs</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" class="checkbox-ingredients" >5 spoons of butter or margarine (either one should work)</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" class="checkbox-ingredients" >2½ spoons of flour (just about, like, give or take a little)</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" class="checkbox-ingredients" >½ spoon of baking soda/yeast powder </li><details>
          <summary></summary>(or something like that, i don't remember the actual name in english, but it's the one you use for cakes to grow.)
        </details>
        <li><input type="checkbox">pieces of chocolate (optional, but very recommended [this is a chocolate cookie recipe after all.])</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox">(optional) 1 table spoon of cocoa powder, or chocolate powder (or maybe more, go by you taste, again just whatever you have on hand.)</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="preparing">
      <h2>Preparing</h2>
 <ol>
    <li>Pre-heat the oven at around 180°C</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Grease pan with butter/margarine and flour</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Mix sugar and butter/margarine until somewhat uniform</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Add eggs and mix until smooth</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Slowly add flour while mixing in between the adding, until not sticking to the bowl or hands. Here, after 2 cups or so of flour, you slow down on it, go mixing and adding the flour, that way you don't risk passing a good batter texture</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>This is where you add the baking soda, make sure to mix it well</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>If chosen, add the chocolate cocoa powder</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Add the chocolate pieces</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Bake at about 250°C for around 20 minutes, I prefer to let it cool for little bit inside the oven, but it should be good to take and let it cool outside of it.</li>
  </ol>

      <p>This one i actually found on the internet, but it is not in english in my files so I can look it up more easily. So I had to translate it to english, some words may not be exact ones, or the proper ones, but the message should have been passed clearly.</p>
      <p>I have heard that baking is more of an exact science, but so far, I have been doing things in the good old way of "Ya, this should be good enough". This one usually lasts about two days in my place. Maybe three.</p>
      <p>Not much to comment about this recipe. It's simple, doesn't actually take that long to make, and tastes pretty good. I've made some this week, and they came out so fluffy and I decided to add 1½ spoons of cocoa powder, delicious. Thinking about eating the last one after dinner.</p>
